## TaxDown frontend challenge


### About the position üíª

Being a **Frontend Engineer** means that you know how to apply the best solutions to the problems that can appear in the client of a Web Application  (don't forget about the communication with backend services!).
So we are going to test that and see how good of a developer you are regarding the frontend part of a project! üî•

### Take me to the challenge! ü§ü

In this challenge (wont be long, we promise), you'll be using **React** to create a SPA that renders a form given. The data of this form should be given from an API. This API could be a fake API created for example with ***json-server*** or similars,the key is to be able to create an architecture that allows the front to communicate with the API.

Here's the sample JSON data structure that should provide the fake API:

```
{
	"inputFields":  [
		{
			"id":  "name",
			"label":  "Name",
			"placeholder":  "Your first name",
			"type":  "text",
			"maxLength":  20
		},
		{
			"id":  "surname",
			"label":  "Surname",
			"placeholder":  "Your last name",
			"type":  "text",
			"maxLength":  40
		},
		{
			"id":  "age",
			"label":  "Age",
			"placeholder":  "Your age",
			"type":  "number",
		}
	]
}
```

We use webpack like bundler so it's important that the project make use of it, you are free to use another bundler (the use of webpack will be a plus!).


#### First step ü•á

The form should be able to grow in size depending on the new input given in the API.

After showing the form, let the user fill the fields and submit the answer (a `console.log()` should be enough to show it).

Remember that some fields may have validations in their keys (`maxLength` for the text inputs) and they can increase or change in the future.

PS: Don't forget to give it some style (not too crazy, just make it look nice)!

#### Second step ü•à

We got the form running and submitting our data! So now what?

We are using the latest React APIs in our projects, so you'll have to face **Context and Hooks** in your daily life with us. Did you use class components? Let's make them into functional ones and use hooks to handle the state properly! üí™

And now that you have some hooks around, let's store all our submissions into a global state in our application.

```
	// exampleState.js

	const state = {
		submissions: [], // Insert the submissions in this attribute
	}
```

This state should be store using Redux. It's important use Redux Sagas or similars to handling the asynchronous side effects of Redux.


#### Third  step ü•â (These medals should go from bronce to gold)

Last step and we are done! We are saving our submissions in the state, so let's go and show them in a list of some kind!

You should use **React Router** to create a new route with the list and one with the form we created before.

In the new **List** route, show all submissions by mapping them so we can see the key/value pairs introduced by the user. Each submission should be able to be deleted and edited.

```
	Submission 1
		Name: Bruce
		Surname: Wayne
		Age: 26
	Submission 2
		Name: Clark
		Surname: Kent
		Age: 22
```

And last but not least, it would be great if you added one or two **tests** to check for render stability or proper mapping of values ‚≠êÔ∏è. We use **jest** and **react-testing-library** to testing.

Easy and simple no? **So we are done!** üöÄ!

### How can I share my solution?

I guess you used Git all the way here and made a few commits already, so how about creating a private repo and inviting us?

This way, we can review your code and have it at hand for the next step, a personal interview! üëª

Check who you should share it with:

Good luck with the challenge! Enjoy it and do your best!
