<p>Being a <strong>Frontend Engineer</strong> means that you know how to apply the best solutions to the problems that can appear in the client of a Web Application  (don’t forget about the communication with backend services!).<br>
So we are going to test that and see how good of a developer you are regarding the frontend part of a project! 🔥</p>
<h3 id="take-me-to-the-challenge-🤟">Take me to the challenge! 🤟</h3>
<p>In this challenge (wont be long, we promise), you’ll be using <strong>React</strong> to create a SPA that renders a form given an input in the form a JSON file.</p>
<p>To create the project, you can use <strong>create react app</strong> for speed! 🏎</p>
<p>Here’s the sample JSON file you can use to complete the exercise:</p>
<pre><code>{
	"inputFields":  [
		{
			"id":  "name",
			"label":  "Name",
			"placeholder":  "Your first name",
			"type":  "text",
			"maxLength":  20
		},
		{
			"id":  "surname",
			"label":  "Surname",
			"placeholder":  "Your last name",
			"type":  "text",
			"maxLength":  40
		},	
		{
			"id":  "age",
			"label":  "Age",
			"placeholder":  "Your age",
			"type":  "number", 
		}
	]
}
</code></pre>
<p>Just create it and import in your files, it will appear as an object!</p>
<h4 id="first-step-🥇">First step 🥇</h4>
<p>The form should be able to grow in size depending on the new input given in that file (imagine we have an API that provides these values).</p>
<p>After showing the form, let the user fill the fields and submit the answer (a <code>console.log()</code> should be enough to show it).</p>
<p>Remember that some fields may have validations in their keys (<code>maxLength</code> for the text inputs) and they can increase or change in the future.</p>
<p>PS: Don’t forget to give it some style (not too crazy, just make it look nice)!</p>
<h4 id="second-step-🥈">Second step 🥈</h4>
<p>We got the form running and submitting our data! So now what?</p>
<p>We are using the latest React APIs in our projects, so you’ll have to face <strong>Context and Hooks</strong> in your daily life with us. Did you use class components? Let’s make them into functional ones and use hooks to handle the state properly! 💪</p>
<p>And now that you have some hooks around, let’s store all our submissions into a global state in our application.</p>
<pre><code>	// exampleState.js
	
	const state = {
		submissions: [], // Insert the submissions in this attribute
	}
</code></pre>
<p>How can I do this? You have a good variety of options, so go with the one you feel more comfortable with. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don’t you have much time?</strong> Go with a state in your App component and update that one. Be careful with the <strong>prop drilling</strong>!  (Psst, <code>useReducer</code> can be a good approach for this).</li>
<li><strong>Are you familiar with hooks?</strong> How about simulating the Redux pattern using <code>useContext</code>? Think about how this could affect our app life cycle.</li>
<li><strong>Did you use Redux before?</strong> Just use Redux so we know how far can you go, or some similar library (MobX, ReactN, easy-peasy…).</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember to <strong>use the one you feel more comfortable with</strong>, don’t waste your time going crazy on this, we just want to see how you are structuring the code and how clean it is!</p>
<h4 id="third--step-🥉-these-medals-should-go-from-bronce-to-gold">Third  step 🥉 (These medals should go from bronce to gold)</h4>
<p>Last step and we are done! We are saving our submissions in the state, so let’s go and show them in a list of some kind!</p>
<p>You can use <strong>React Router</strong> to create a new route with the list and one with the form we created before.</p>
<p>In the new <strong>List</strong> route, show all submissions by mapping them so we can see the key/value pairs introduced by the user.</p>
<pre><code>	Submission 1
		Name: Bruce
		Surname: Wayne
		Age: 26
	Submission 2
		Name: Clark
		Surname: Kent
		Age: 22
</code></pre>
<p>And last but not least, it would be great if you added one or two <strong>tests</strong> to check for render stability or proper mapping of values ⭐️.</p>
<p>Easy and simple no? <strong>So we are done!</strong> 🚀!</p>
<h3 id="how-can-i-share-my-solution">How can I share my solution?</h3>
<p>I guess you used Git all the way here and made a few commits already, so how about creating a private repo and inviting us?</p>

<p>This way, we can review your code and have it at hand for the next step, a personal interview! 👻</p>
<p>Good luck with the challenge! Enjoy it and do your best!</p>
