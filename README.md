## About us

We love to get our hands dirty, each developer is owner of his own deployment cycle, from unit tests to DevOps. Besides, we work hard with math libraries, process automation, pseudo-languages and serverless, no time to get bored :boom:

If you love to start from scratch and you dream with erradicating repetitive tasks, in TaxDown we are building the future of tax and giving our customers a 360 service. Our customers love us and we love them! They value us with an NPS of 75 :gift: (more on [nps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter))

And the press like us too! :newspaper:
